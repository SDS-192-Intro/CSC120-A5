- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

What I notice about Association is that it acts as a connector for all the classes in my code. What isn't working right now is calling values from different classes to talk to each other. I still have some confusion on that part. A peice of advice that I would give to someone else taking this course is to carefully go through in-class examples and watch the overview videos.
